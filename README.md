# Fibonacci Node

### :sound: This simple project was built based on the classes of the AcceleraDev React course made available by [CodeNation](https://codenation.dev/)

The design basically consists of two functions, one function generates an array with fibonacci numbers up to 350, and the other function checks whether a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.
